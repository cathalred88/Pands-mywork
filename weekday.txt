# import datetime module as dt so we can differientiate it against the class type with the same name
import datetime as dt
# sets the x variable to be the time value for "now", which takes a snapshot of the time the code is executed.
# x = dt.datetime.now()
# alternative code to allow the date to be set manually, to check the else branch of the if statement in line 25
x = dt.datetime(2025, 2, 12)

# returns the exact date and time as an object with a "hash number" (eg. 0x0000025956B230F0)
# print(x.isoweekday)

# returns the weekday in string format which is more readable for humans. %A is the code for weekday written out in longformat - as "Wednesday"
# print(x.strftime("%A"))
y = int(x.strftime("%w"))
z = str(x.strftime("%A"))

# manually check the outputs have correct formats and contents - disabled from running in final code 
# print(x)
# print (type(x))
# print (y)
# print (type(y))
# print (z)
# print (type(z))

if (z == ('Saturday')): 
    print ("it is {}, which is the weekend, Yay".format(z))
elif (z == ('Sunday')):
    print ("it is {}, which is the weekend, Yay".format(z))
else:
    print ("Yes, unfortunately today is {}, a weekday. ".format(z))


# I struggled to get the sunday to read correctly as part of a "nested if-or" statement here. 
# Sunday returns the Int value 0 for Y, which should be included in the if branch, but i cannot get the if statement to detect it properly. possibly due to a type mismatch between strings and integers ? 

# if (y == (0 or 6)): 
    # print ("it is {}, which is the weekend, Yay".format(z))

# else:
    # print ("Yes, unfortunately today is {}, a weekday. ".format(z))
