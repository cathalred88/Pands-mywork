## Project plan / Design intent 
# I have started this project late as i was busy with work first, then i was away on holiday with no access to my laptop, so i now have 4 weeks to complete this project. 
# I will manage this project timeline in the Burn-down approach, where my submission date is the endpoint and i need to allot my time backwards from there to achieve the program fucntionality. 
# I intend to have the main program functionally complete by the end of week 2, which allows for a week of clean up / improvements, and a week of overshoot mitigation. 
# This approach should peform 2 main objectives: primary goal to set a SMART goal in which i am timebound to copmlete the project by a certain date (* deadlines help my ADHD brain), and secondly to allow for the inevetable delays and interruptions that are a frequent feaure of my life!
