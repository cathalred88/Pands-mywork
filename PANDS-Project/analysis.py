## Project plan / Design intent 
# I have started this project late as i was busy with work first, then i was away on holiday with no access to my laptop, so i now have 4 weeks to complete this project. 
# I will manage this project timeline in the Burn-down approach, where my submission date is the endpoint and i need to allot my time backwards from there to achieve the program fucntionality. 
# I intend to have the main program functionally complete by the end of week 2, which allows for a week of clean up / improvements, and a week of overshoot mitigation. 
# This approach should peform 2 main objectives: primary goal to set a SMART goal in which i am timebound to copmlete the project by a certain date (* deadlines help my ADHD brain), and secondly to allow for the inevetable delays and interruptions that are a frequent feaure of my life!

## Import libraries & Functions
#import numpy as np
#import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

## Definitions of variables
path = "../PANDS-Project/"
FILENAME ="iris.data"

## Subroutine definitions

#def readDict():
    # this will throw an error if the file does not exist
    # it should readly just return an empty dict
    # we can do this later
    #with open(FILENAME) as f:
        #return json.load(f)

## Main Program
df = pd.read_fwf(FILENAME, sep=',', names=["Sepal Length","Sepal Width","Petal Length","Petal Width","Species"])
pd.options.display.max_rows = 150
print(df)
print(df.describe())
