README.txt for PANDS-Project
This file is a Readme file for the PANDS project, submitted in fulfilment of requirement for the Higher diploma in Computer Science and Data Analytics in Atlantic Technical University. 
Readme.txt compiled by Cathal Redmond during March-May 2025. to aid with the comprehension of the work herewithin contained, and to document the development of the code/script solutions put forward to complete the tasks required. 

Executive Overview: 
The IRIS dataset is a popular educational resource, used as a test dataset to allow students to develop their coding skills. 

Background:
The Iris dataset was first published in 1936 in the academic Journal 'Annals of Eugenics' (now 'Annals of Human Genetics') by biologist Ronald Fisher, as an demonstration of statistical methods of classification of different species of Iris flower plants(1). The data is an example of a multivariate data set, in that it contains multiple observations & recordings of a test subject, taken simultaniously (2). The data was collected by Edgar Anderson at the John Innes Horticultural institution in the UK (3). The dataset is now hosted and maintained by University of California at Irvine (4).

Iris Dataset Description:
The Dataset has 150 lines of text, each an instance/ observation of Iris plant measurments. 50 instances of three species ae listed in the dataset. The data is available for download from the UC irvine website, after which it must be unzipped and saved to the location it will be used from. Four files are present in the zipped folder: Iris.data, bezdekIris.data, iris.names, and Indes. The data is organised into 150 lines of text, with 5 distinct text items on each line reading from left to right; 4 floating point values followed by one text string. The iris dataset file does not contain headers, line value indicators or any other meta-info. 
Information about the Iris dataset is given in the Iris.names file, where the numbers in each of the rows are identified as being measurments; 
1. sepal length (in cm)
2. sepal width (in cm)
3. petal length (in cm)
4. petal width (in cm)
5. class: (Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica)

Desired outcome: 
The desired outcomes of this excercise are many; the primary goal is to learn how to source and analyse data using Python tools. The Iris dataset is a good test case on which to perform this task, as it is extensively studied and there exists a good many examples of analysis previously performed on the dataset that are freely available to be found online. 
The secondary, more important intention is that the student will learn how to research the techniques needed to perform the task in an efficient and expedient manner. The student will need to go beyond what has been taught in lectures to achieve this goal; and therefore will learn the higher cognative goals of research and self-directed problem solving, which are essential in the perpetually evolving modern digital landscape. As new tools become available, they bring with them a raft of new compatability and integration issues; This is the norm for rapidly advancing technical fields - by learning the problem solving tools on an extremely popular system using a well documented dataset, a robust framework can be built from which to tackle more intensive or specialist techniques.
